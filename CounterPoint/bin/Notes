don't use tritones in the Major 3rd + Major 3rd sense, but diminished 5th are ok? 
	
	
	cantus Firmus Score:
	too much direction change/total notes
	
	
	Have the valid itnervals be part of the Cantus Firmus, so it is altered each time the valid intervals are done. 

	
	4.  The harmonic intervals between the beginning and the next-to-last note may be major or minor thirds, 
	major or minor sixths, perfect or augmented fifths, perfect octaves or perfect unisons.  Use thirds and sixths the most. 
	 If you use an augmented fifth, both voices must move by contrary motion and by second to form a third on the following note.
	  Note that for now you are only using consonant intervals and the tritone. 
	
	
	A perfect fifth may move to a diminished fifth, but not the other way. 
	This rule also seems arbitrary but it also has a musical justification.  
	The diminished fifth (or tritone) must always be left by contrary motion, 
	creating a third (the voices will move inward).  To do otherwise confuses our sense of mode or key.
	
	
	if second species starts an octacve away it can't end on unison.
	
	Dorian, Aeolian, and Mixolydian don't have diatonic leading tones and so we raise the 7th scale degree in those modes. 
	However, when writing in Ionian, Phrygian (which has a diatonically flat 2nd scale degree), and Lydian, 
	it is not uncommon to write in a B-flat, F-sharp, or E-flat (respectively) and save the diatonic leading tones for
	 final cadences. 
			
//		
//		Avoid combining similar motion with leaps, especially large ones.
	  

private static void leapCheck(String notes[]) {
		
		
		
	}
	
	private static void leadingTone() {
//		the leading tone progresses to the tonic
//		in minor, the leading tone only appears in the penultimate bar; the raised submediant is only used when progressing to that leading tone
	}

	private static void noHiddenCantusFirmus() {
		//can't have a cantus firmus within a cantus firmus?
	}


to vary it up, set the end note to be a different degree in the scale, and start a new cantus 
firmus on that note in a different mode once you get there? 


Cantus Firmus is a Melody that has a list of First Species that are also Melodies

Species Builder has a MelodyInProgress that gets converted in the constructor of Cantus Firmus into Cantus Firmus.
